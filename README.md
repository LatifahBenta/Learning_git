# Learning git

This is my first commit.

## How to git commit

Start by initializing your local repo by using the command.

`git init`

## Stage your commits

We stage commits using the command.

`git add .`

**Note** This will ensure all your changes are ready to be staged to your remote repo.

## Add a commit message

Adding a commit message tells other people what changes you have made to the code you were working on. To do this we use the command:

`git commit -m 'your commit message'`

## Create the main branch

Create a main branch by use of:

`git branch -m main`

## Connect your local repo with the remote repo

We connect your local repo with remote repo by using the command:

`git remote add origin https://github.com/LatifahBenta/example.git`

## Finally push your changes to the remote repo

We push our changes to the remote repo by use:

`git push -u origin main`
